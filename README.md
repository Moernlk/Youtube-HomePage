Hi!! Hope you are fine :)
This is the first project I developed. 
Which is a clone from the Youtube main page.
I got the idea from a youtube video for learning HTML/CSS structures.
At the time I did not know of JavaScript or JSON usabilities so I manually created each text and image area repeatedly.
What generated the HUGE main document with more then 1000 lines. 

It was very pleasing to create the page so I have a kind memory of this project.

It also chages size, using "@media".

PS: I customized the scrool-bar of the page. :)

And every single button has a pop-up name that appears with the cursor interaction. 

Also, there is the notification numbers in red backgrounds, very cute, I know.
